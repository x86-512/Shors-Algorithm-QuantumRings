Over the past 24 hours, we built this project to find factors of semi primes using a quantum algorithm (mainly Shor’s Algorithm). The basic implementation for the Shor’s Algorithm revolves around prime factorization. We worked on the application of modular exponentiation and the implementation of Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform (IQFT) which converts the state from the Fourier Basics back to the computational basics. IQFT has been implemented in code through Hadamard Gates and Controlled Phase Shift Gates in order to factor a number using Quantum principles. This document is a detailed synopsis of the principals applied for Quantum Factorization code implemented using Quantum Rings Library.
